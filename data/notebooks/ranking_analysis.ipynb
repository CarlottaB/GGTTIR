    "Was wir eigentlich rausfinden wollen ist, ob die Think Tanks in den neu hinzugefügten Kategorien vorher schon im Ranking waren. Vor allem interessiert uns ob die Top 10/Top 20 in anderen Kategorien vorher schon so hoch gerankt wurden. Unsere Vermutung ist es, dass die neuen Kategorien vor allem dazukommen um mehr Think Tanks hoch zu ranken. Dadurch wird das Ranking für eine größere Anzahl an Think Tanks interessant und diese machen dann das Ranking populärer. \n",
